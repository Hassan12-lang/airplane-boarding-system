        "Because a singly linked list can go ahead effectively without requiring access to elements in both directions, we utilized it to generate the passenger and luggage list. Our needs for managing a simple list that may be used in conjunction with a doubly linked list to seat people in their assigned seats are met by this data structure. Each node in a singly linked list has a data field and a reference to the node after it. The last node in the list points to null to signify the list's end. Because of its linear structure, which makes insertion and deletion operations more efficient, it can be used in a wide range of situations.\n",
        "By building a new node with the given value and connecting it to the existing final node, we were able to add passenger nodes to the end of the list in our implementation. The new node becomes the head if the list is empty; if not, we move through the list until we get to the last node, at which time we update the next pointer of the final node to link to the new node, so adding it to the end of the list.A while loop iterates through the list until the current pointer hits null after initializing a pointer called \"current\" to the top of the list. We transfer the current pointer to the next node and print the current node's data inside the loop.\n",

        "We employed a doubly linked list data structure because of its effectiveness in managing a collection of nodes, where each node comprises a value and two pointers: one that references the previous node and another that points to the next node. This capability for bidirectional traversal offers significant advantages, particularly in scenarios that require regular insertions and deletions. Furthermore, we created a priority heap using the doubly linked list to ensure that elderly passengers, aged 65 and older, were seated at the front of the plane. Passengers under 65 were assigned their respective seats by inserting them either before or after existing nodes, utilizing the head and tail pointers. This strategy allowed us to efficiently manage seating arrangements based on age. The next and previous pointers facilitated easy navigation through the list, enabling us to add passengers to the doubly linked list as needed. We employed this setup to support both stack and queue operations: inserting at the end of the list represented queue behavior, while inserting at the beginning simulated stack functionality. To handle the unboarding and unloading processes for both passengers and luggage, we traversed the list in both directions. This method was crucial for allowing elderly passengers to exit first, followed by the remaining passengers in ascending order of age. Simultaneously, we ensured that luggage unloading prioritized the first items loaded, resulting in an efficient and orderly process.\n",
